# Open Steam Controller Development  Board

This is to mod the controller with a custom firmware that turns the controller into
a development board used for figuring out how the controller works. To install take
the `OpenSteamControllerDevBoard.bin` file and rename it to `firmware.bin`. Then
follow the instructions to load the [firmware onto your controller](/LoadingFirmware.md).

Access to the source code and how to compile a build as well as more details can be
found in the [Firmware](/Firmware) subproject.

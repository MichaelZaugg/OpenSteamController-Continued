This includes almost everything inside the controller except these parts:

* Left/Right Battery Housing
* Left/Right Battery Housing Baseplate
* Battery Latch Tension Holder (The weird half circle part with the really small vertical spring)
* Left/Right Trigger Mount To Cap Assembly
* Left/Right Trackpad Arms

## User Created Models - Unofficial

These models are unofficial and not made by Valve. The purpose of these models is to complete
the CAD Steam Controller and provide a source for future modding/replacement parts. 

You can find the current models in the [Unofficial](./Unofficial) directory.

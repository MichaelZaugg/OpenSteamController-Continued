# Official CAD Models by Valve

You can find the official CAD files on Steam [here](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/353370/view/3931035846865618326).

This includes almost everything insight the controller except a few parts.

## User Created Models - Unofficial

These models are unofficial and not made by Valve. The purpose of these models is to complete
the Steam Controller CAD models. For example we are not given the left/right trackpad arms, or
the battery housing, along with a few other bits and pieces. 

You can find the current models in the [Unofficial](./Unofficial) directory.
